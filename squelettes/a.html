<div class="quote-line">Poor Isabella's Dead, whose
abdication</div>
<div class="quote-line">Set all tongues wagging in the Spanish
nation.</div>
<div class="quote-line">For that performance 'twere unfair to
scold her:</div>
<div class="quote-line">She wisely left a throne too hot to
hold her.</div>
<div class="quote-line">To History she'll be no royal riddle

<h3 class="term">ABSOLUTE</h3>
<div class="part">adj.</div>
<div class="definition">
Independent, irresponsible. An absolute monarchy is one in which
the sovereign does as he pleases so long as he pleases the
assassins. Not many absolute monarchies are left, most of them
having been replaced by limited monarchies, where the sovereign's
power for evil (and for good) is greatly curtailed, and by
republics, which are governed by chance.
