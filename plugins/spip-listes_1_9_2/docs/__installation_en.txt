Allows the creation of newsletters from a SPIP site (http://www.spip.net), either manually or automatically.

To achieve this task, SPIP-Listes lets you:

write messages
manage subscribers lists where every subscriber have the possibility to subscribe, un-subscribe and choose the message format most suitable for them (html or text)
send information by e-mail with a regular frequency if you so wish
automatically send the latest from the site or a customised Spip template
modify the layout of what you send at your leisure.

There is a ToDo list on the site bloog.net at: http://bloog.net/spip.php?article115 

Installation

I.Installation of the SPIP-Listes plugin files
1)extract the .zip archive
2)upload by FTP the resulting folder spip-Listes/ (and its sub-folders) without any modification to the /plugins folder in your site (you must create it if it doesn't exist)
II.Calling SPIP-Listes from your templates
1)add the code  #FORMULAIRE_ABONNEMENT to the template where you want to display the registration form. You can use a custom template instead of formulaire_abonnement.html (to manage the registration to a particular list for instance) with the code #FORMULAIRE_ABONNEMENT{my_template}.
Note: the page abonnement.html manages the modifications/un-subscriptions of the subscribers.
2)in the plugin folder, edit the stencil files /patrons/nouveautes.html and /patrons/patron_simple.html and adapt the images URLs to your site.
Warning, if the selection is based on age loops, the template should return an empty message if an error occurs.
You can create all the stencils you want and store them in this folder and they will appear automatically amongst the choices in the private area.
III.Using  SPIP-Listes in the private area
1)In the Configuration menu, click on Manage plugins.
2)Check the  SPIP-Listes plugin to activate it then click on Submit.
3)In the Site Edit menu, click on Newsletters (or go directly to the page with http://your_site.net/ecrire/?exec=spip_listes)
You are ready now:

4)create one or more mailing lists and subscribers (you can import a list of subscribers).

Have  fun
